# INFINITE METAVERSE ALLIANCE

*Disclaimer: We were unable to fully upload our Substrate node to Github due to files being too big. The demo is in our YouTube video.*


*Disclaimer 2.0: The OpenSimulator team does not allow us to upload their servers onto Github for security reasons. The demo is in our YouTube video.*

This project started at the Babylong Project Hackathon but will continue development until completion. 

The Problem: In OpenSimulator Virtual Reality programs, there are creative merchants who make virtual goods and services, and sell them for virtual currency. Unfortunately, their intellectual property rights are not protected by the OpenSimulator program, discouraging them from creating and causing harm to their livelihood.

On OpenSimulator, people can buy a creator's asset from the creator's VR server (also known as a Region), then they can take the asset to their own VR region. Once the asset is on your VR region, you can do whatever you want with it even if you didn't create it. This is where the threat to intellectual & creative property rights comes in. Once someone else's product is in your region, you can: 

- sell this asset for profit
- change the creatorID and claim you made it 
- get into the code and make infinite copies of the asset
- edit the permissions and database of the asset

There is no cross-regional security in openSimulator preventing people's property from being stolen. That is what we aim to fix. And we want to use blockchain to do it.
